## 🐛 Troubleshooting

npm install
# or
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Issue: Tailwind classes not working
**Solution:**
Make sure `globals.css` is imported in your main file:
```typescript
// In main.tsx or App.tsx
import './globals.css'
```

### Issue: Colors not showing
**Solution:**
Ensure `tailwind.config.ts` is in the root directory and has the custom colors defined.

### Issue: Buttons not working in Lovable
**Solution:**
Lovable might need the `react-router-dom` package:
```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```
